# email-spam-detection-model
## ðŸ“Š ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“‰ Introduction
This project involved the analysis of an email dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in python inorder to draw insights from the characteristics of Spam and Non-Spam (Ham) emails, including their lengths, number of words and other factors, and how this factors relate to their Spam or Non-Spam status. A word cloud was created to show the most common words found in Spam emails, providing insights into words which are most likely to trigger the classification of a mail as being spam. The end goal of this project was to train a model to classify mails as either spam or ham (non-spam), effectively keeping our mail box clean.
