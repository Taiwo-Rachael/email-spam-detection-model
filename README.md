# 🚀✉️ Email Spam Detection Model: Filtering the Junk, One Email at a Time!
## 📊 📉 Introduction
In today's digital age, inboxes are constantly under siege by unwanted emails, from fake promotions to phishing scams. Sometimes, really important emails end up in the spam folder, which could at times be really frustrating, or even lead to missing important deadlines. This project is designed to combat that flood of junk by implementing an Email Spam Detection Model that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to distinguish between ham (legitimate emails) and spam (unwanted emails). This model will help to ensure inboxes are kept clean and important emails do not end up in the spam folder. 

By analyzing key features such as word frequency, email length, and more, this model learns from patterns in email content, detecting common spam triggers and filtering them out with precision. Let's dive in!

## 📊 📈  The Dataset
The dataset used for this project consisted of five columns. The main columns being:

**v2 (Emails):** Containing the email texts

**v1 (Status):** Indicating whether each email is classified as spam or ham.

Additionally, there were three unnamed columns with over 90% missing values, which were removed during the data cleaning process. The dataset originally comprised 5,572 emails before any cleaning was performed.
