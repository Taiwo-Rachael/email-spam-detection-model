# 🚀✉️ Email Spam Detection Model: Filtering the Junk, One Email at a Time!
## 📊 📉 Introduction
In today's digital age, inboxes are constantly under siege by unwanted emails, from fake promotions to phishing scams. Sometimes, really important emails end up in the spam folder, which could at times be very frustrating, or even lead to missing important deadlines. It's usually not a funny feeling when you go through your spam folder only to find that email you have been waiting for sitting right there! especially if it has caused you to miss out on an important opportunity. This project is designed to combat that flood of junk by training an Email Spam Detection Model that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to distinguish between ham (legitimate emails) and spam (unwanted emails). This model will help to ensure inboxes are kept clean and important emails do not end up in the spam folder. 

By analyzing key features such as word frequency, email length, and more, this model learns from patterns in email content, detecting common spam triggers and filtering them out with precision. In the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Taiwo-Rachael/email-spam-detection-model/blob/main/Email_Spam_Detection_Model.ipynb), you'll be able to see my full coding process showing how I carried out the following steps for this project:

1. Data Cleaning  
2. Feature Engineering  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Email Preprocessing
5. Word Cloud Generation
6. Encoding and Vectorization
7. Model Selection and Training
8. Model Evaluation and Demonstration

## 🧹🧹 Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Getting the dataset clean and ready for analysis involved a number of processes, including dropping off the unnamed columns, removing 403 duplicated entries and renaming the v1 column as 'Label' and v2 as 'Email' for clarity. After cleaning, the dataset contained 5169 rows and 2 columns. To gain deeper insights into the nature and characteristics of spam and ham emails, two new columns, 'Email Length' and 'Length of Words' were created. The email length was generated by applying the 'len' function to each mail while the length of words was generated by applying the 'word_tokenize' and 'len' function to each mail.

##  🔍 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Taking a deep dive into the dataset revealed some interesting insights, including the fact that spam emails tend to be longer than ham emails, and also contain more words. A correlation analysis however, revealed that the length of words and email length in themselves are not strong enough factors to determine whether or not an email will be classified as either spam or ham, with correlation coefficients of 0.26 and 0.38 respectively with the label.



## ✉️🧹 Email Preprocessing

**Word Cloud**
To gain deeper insights into what words would trigger the classification of an email as spam, a word cloud showing the most common 15 words in the spam emails was generated
